# RSS Reader

Rss reader was made as a project for a 
college course on python. It starts off 
with four rss feeds but you can add more 
feeds via the application itself
or you can modify data.json and add an rss url
along with a custom key name.
There are 5 components total each with their own
class. Most of the work is done from readRSS.py
and dataTree.py.
